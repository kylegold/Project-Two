We have a header with potentially the quiz app logo
then.
We have a form to create a Quiz
this form has two inputs
input one is for quiz title
input two is for quiz description

..

We then have a second form to create questions with choices.
this form is generated when the user clicks the NEW QUESTION button. the Question model has one input. Within each generated question form there is a button to add NEW CHOICE, generating the Option model which has one input and one checkbox (for a boolean isCorrect)

..

Upon submiting the submit button Quiz.title.val() and Quiz.description.val() are used to create a new quiz in the Quiz table. Question.question.val() is used to create a new quiz question. Option.choice.val() is used to create a new option and Option.isCorrect.val() is used to check if option is the correct answer to the question.
